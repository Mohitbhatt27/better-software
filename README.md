## Design Choices Made

1. Used Vite as the build tool.
2. Added Formik for form handling and Yup for validation.
3. Implemented a password strength indicator to enhance security awareness among users.

## Assumptions or Limitations

1. The application does not include backend integration
2. The user data is not persisted beyond form submission.
