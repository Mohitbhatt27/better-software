# Better Software Internship Project

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohitbhatt27/better-software.git
   cd better-software-internship
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Design Choices Made

1. Used Vite as the build tool for its speed and ease of use.
2. Employed Formik for form handling and Yup for validation, ensuring a smooth user experience.
3. Implemented a password strength indicator to enhance security awareness among users.

## Assumptions or Limitations

1. The application does not include backend integration; user data is not persisted beyond form submission.
2. Further enhancements, such as routing and state management, can be implemented as needed.
